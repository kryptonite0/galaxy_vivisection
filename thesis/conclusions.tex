In this thesis, we explored several scaling relations between the supermassive black hole mass 
and various properties of the host spheroid, 
aiming at gaining a more profound understanding of the co-evolution between SMBHs and galaxies. 
A summary of our principal findings and some additional brief considerations about them are presented here. 
The end of this Chapter incorporates some promising future research directions. \\

In Chapter \ref{ch:recov-mn} \citep{savorgnan2013}, we compared the results obtained by four independent studies 
\citep{grahamdriver2007,sani2011,vika2012,beifiori2012}
that attempted photometric decompositions for similar samples of galaxies with a direct measurement 
of the black hole mass. 
In many cases, we found a large discrepancy between the S\'ersic index measurements 
obtained by different studies for the spheroidal component of the same galaxy, 
either due to a significantly different choice of model components 
or to various systematic effects that led to inaccurate decompositions. 
By rejecting the most discrepant S\'ersic index measurements and averaging the remaining ones, 
we were able to recover a strong $M_{\rm BH} - n_{\rm sph}$ relation, 
which was not found in the individual datasets of three of the four studies.
