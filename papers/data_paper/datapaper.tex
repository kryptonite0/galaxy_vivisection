\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:int}
Supermassive black holes and host bulges have very different sizes. 
If the event horizon of the Galactic supermassive black hole was as big as a grain of sand of the Sahara desert, 
then the black hole gravitational sphere-of-influence would be as big as the international airport of Cairo, 
and the Galactic bulge would be as big as the Sahara desert itself.
It is thus surprising that the masses of supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH}$) 
scale with a number of properties of their host bulges, 
indicating the non-gravitational origin of these correlations 
(e.g.~\citealt{dressler1989,yee1992,kormendyrichstone1995,laor1997,magorrian1998,ferraresemerritt2000,gebhardt2000,graham2001,
marconihunt2003,haringrix2004,graham2012bent,grahamscott2015}). \\
The tightness of (i.e.~the small scatter about) the observed black hole mass correlations has led to the idea
that black holes and host galaxies have coevolved with some sort of self-regulated growth.
Exploring the evolution of this growth with cosmic time could help identify
the driving mechanisms of the black hole -- galaxy coevolution.
Observations at $z=0$ set the local benchmark from which to measure this evolution.
Any complete theory or model describing the coevolution of galaxies and black holes must incorporate 
all of the observed scaling relations, which also have to be consistent with each other.
%Modern semi-analytic models use the observed black hole mass scaling relations 
%to constrain the black hole accretion rate .
Modern hydrodynamical simulations, such as EAGLE \citep{schaye2015}, calibrate the feedback efficiencies 
to match the $z=0$ black hole mass -- galaxy mass relation.
Such scaling relations can also be employed to predict the masses of black holes in other galaxies, where a direct
measure of $M_{\rm BH}$ would be extremely time consuming or simply impossible due to technological limitations.
Moreover, many accurate $M_{\rm BH}$ predictions enable one to derive 
the local black hole mass function (e.g.~\citealt{salucci1999,graham2007smbhmassfunction}) 
and space density (e.g.~\citealt{grahamdriver2007smbhmassdensity,comastri2015}). 
All of these examples depend on the $z=0$ relations, 
and as such the recalibration of the black hole mass -- bulge stellar mass ratio ($M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm *,sph}$) in large bulges,
from $0.1 - 0.2\%$ (e.g.~\citealt{haringrix2004}) to $0.36\%$ \citep{graham2012bent} and then $0.49\%$ \citep{grahamscott2015}, 
has many substantial implications. \\
Since the early stellar dynamical detections of black holes were carried out in the '80s 
(see the references in the reviews by \citealt{kormendyrichstone1995}, \citealt{richstone1998} 
and \citealt{graham2015bulges} for pioneering papers), 
the number of (direct) black hole mass measurements has increased with time 
and it has recently become a statistically meaningful sample  
with which one can study SMBH demographics. 
It is now generally accepted that supermassive black holes reside at the center of most, if not all, 
massive galaxies, either quiescent or active. \\
Massive, early-type galaxies are often composite systems. 
The knowledge that many ``elliptical'' galaxies actually contain embedded stellar disks dates back  
at least three decades  
\citep{capaccioli1987,carter1987,rixwhite1990,bender1990,scorzabender1990,nieto1991,rixwhite1992,scorzabender1995}. 
After examining long-slit and integral field unit spectroscopic observations of morphologically classified elliptical galaxies in the Fornax cluster, 
\cite{donofrio1995}, \cite{graham1998fornax} and \cite{scott2014} concluded that only 3 bright galaxies do not harbour a disk-like component.
Larger surveys with integral field spectrographs of early-type galaxies, such as the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ Project \citep{cappellari2011}, 
have further advanced this view of ``elliptical'' galaxies being all but simple and featureless pressure-supported systems.
More than half of all morphologically classified elliptical galaxies in the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ sample are fast rotators \citep{atlas3dIII-MNRAS}.
\cite{krajnovic2013} showed that ``fast rotators'' as a class are disk-galaxies or at least disk-like galaxies. 
In their magnitude-limited survey, systems 
without any signature of disk-like components (neither in the kinematics nor in the photometry) 
dominate only the most massive end (beyond $10^{11.5}~\rm M_\odot$) of the distribution. 
Given the prevalence of disks, it is clearly important to perform bulge/disk decompositions, 
if one is to properly explore the black hole-bulge connection. 
Indeed, separating the disk light from that of the bulge has led to the discovery of the missing population of compact, massive spheroids 
in the local Universe \citep{GDS2015}.
If we are to properly understand the evolution of galaxies, we need to understand their components.\\
Measuring the photometric and structural properties of a galaxy's spheroidal component requires the ability to 
separate it from the rest of the galaxy. 
Such galaxy decomposition involves a parametric analysis that allows one to fit the surface brightness distribution
of galaxies using a combination of analytic functions (usually one function per
galaxy component, such as bulges, disks, bars, nuclei, etc.).
The one-dimensional (1D) technique involves fitting isophotes to the galaxy image, extracting the (one-dimensional) surface 
brightness radial profile and modeling it with a combination of analytic functions.
With the two-dimensional (2D) technique, one fits analytic functions directly to the 2D images. \\
Over the past eight years, five independent studies 
\citep{grahamdriver2007,sani2011,vika2012,beifiori2012,lasker2014data,lasker2014anal} have attempted galaxy decomposition
in order to derive the bulge parameters and explore their relation with the black hole masses. 
{\bf Rusli has explored the black hole - core relation.}
Interestingly, the past studies used almost the same sample of galaxies, yet they claimed some contradictory conclusions.
For example, one study \citep{grahamdriver2007} obtained a good $M_{\rm BH}-n_{\rm sph}$ correlation
(the bulge S\'ersic index $n_{\rm sph}$ is a measure of the central radial concentration of stars, \citealt{trujillo2001}), 
whereas the remaining four did not.
In addition, \cite{lasker2014anal} {\bf who did not work at 3.6um} 
declared that $M_{\rm BH}$ correlates equally well with the total galaxy luminosity and the bulge luminosity, 
as opposed to \cite{beifiori2012}, who claimed that the bulge mass is a better tracer of $M_{\rm BH}$ than the galaxy mass.
The past studies did not converge to the same conclusions 
because their best-fit models for the same galaxy were often 
significantly different and not consistent with each other in terms of fitted components. 
Moreover, none of these studies attempted an individual galaxy-by-galaxy 
comparison of their models with the previous literature. 
We have now made this comparison and performed the optimal decompositions,
using $3.6~\rm \mu m$ \emph{Spitzer} satellite imagery, 
which is an excellent proxy for the stellar mass, superior to the $K$-band (\citealt{sheth2010} and references therein).
We will use these in a series of forthcoming papers to obtain improved black hole mass scaling relations 
using the largest sample (66) of galaxies to date.

This paper is structured as follows.
Section \ref{sec:data} presents the galaxy sample and imaging data-set used to conduct this study. 
Section \ref{sec:anal} describes how we performed the galaxy decompositions, 
i.e.~how we identified and modeled the sub-components that constitute our galaxies. 
In Section \ref{sec:res} we outline the results from our analysis and discuss the error analysis. 
Section \ref{sec:concl} summarizes our main conclusions. 
The individual galaxy decompositions are made available in the electronic version of this manuscript.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
%\subsection{Initial sample}
Our initial galaxy sample (see Table \ref{tab:sample}) consists of 75 objects for which a dynamical detection of the black hole mass 
had been reported in the literature at the time we started this project, 
and for which at least one $3.6~\rm \mu m$ \emph{Spitzer}/IRAC\footnote{IRAC is the InfraRed Array Camera onboard the \emph{Spitzer} Space Telescope.} 
observation was publicy available.
Black hole masses were drawn from the catalog of \citet{grahamscott2013} for 70 galaxies,
from \citet{rusli2013bhmassesDM} for 4 galaxies and from \citet{greenhill2003} for 1 galaxy. 
As explained in Section \ref{sec:res}, 
this initial sample was ultimately reduced to 66 galaxies for which useful bulge parameters could be obtained.

\subsection{\emph{Spitzer}/IRAC observations}
\subsubsection{Data acquisition}
For each of our 75 galaxies, we downloaded from the 
Spitzer Heritage Archive\footnote{\url{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Spitzer/SHA/}} 
all the available $3.6~\rm \mu m$ IRAC Astronomical Observation Requests (AORs), 
listed in Table \ref{tab:obs}.
Each AOR is an individual Spitzer observation sequence, and
includes a number of data frames (the individual exposures) and the calibration data.
The data frames were selected to be %``enhanced Level 1 products'', or
corrected Basic Calibrated Data (cBCD), produced by the IRAC Level 1 pipeline. 
This automatic pipeline takes a single ``raw'' image, removes the scattered light, 
and performs dark subtraction, flatfielding correction and flux calibration (into units of $\rm MJy~sr^{-1}$). 
The final product (the BCD) is a flux-calibrated image which has had all the well-understood instrumental signatures removed.
BCD frames are further processed through an ``artifact correction'' pipeline 
that mitigates the commonly found artifacts of stray light, saturation, ``muxbleed'' and column pulldown\footnote{Stray light 
includes scattered light from stars outside the array location as well as filter ghosts from bright stars. 
Multiplexer bleed, or ``muxbleed'', can be generated by stars, hot pixels, and particle hits.
It appears as a decaying trail of pixels, repeating every fourth column.
``Column pulldown'' is caused by a bright pixel that triggers a bias shift within its respective column, 
creating a lower background value throughout the entire column than in the surrounding columns.}.
After the artifact correction has been applied, the BCD becomes a cBCD.

\subsubsection{Mosaicking}
We performed image mosaicking using the MOPEX package \citep{makovozmarleau2005mopex}.
This enabled the production of suitably wide-field-of-view images for accurate sky background subtraction.
Individual cBCD frames with exposure time of $1~\rm sec$ were rejected.
Permanent or semi-permanent bad pixels, contained in a semi-static mask (the ``pmask''), were ignored.
Each AOR is associated to a specific pmask. 
Therefore, when multiple AORs were available for the same galaxy, 
we merged the different pmasks. 
Cosmic ray rejection was performed with the dual outlier and multi-frame techniques.
The pixel size of the mosaic was set to be the same as the input cBCD frames ($1''.22 \times 1''.22$).
For $3.6~\rm \mu m$ observations with this pixel scale, 
the photometric zeropoint magnitude is $m_{\rm zp} = 17.26 \rm~mag$.
The orientation of the mosaic was set to the average rotation angle of the input cBCD frames. 
%{\bf TBD: not n-e oriented or re-sampled because problems with 2d PSF. }
Individual cBCD frames were combined together into a single mosaic with the default linear interpolation algorithm.

\subsubsection{Overlap correction}
Before generating a mosaic, MOPEX can perform background matching among the individual frames
by using the \emph{overlap} module. 
This module calculates and applies an additive correction to the individual frames,
producing a consistent background across the mosaicked image.
According to the \emph{Spitzer Data Cookbook}, the use of the \emph{overlap} module is not particularly recommended for 
$3.6~\rm \mu m$ observations. 
However, after a visual inspection of the mosaics obtained without activating the \emph{overlap} module,
we found that all the mosaics obtained from multiple AORs were affected by patchiness, 
due to bias fluctuations in the CCD array.
For this reason, we re-generated the multiple-AORs mosaics by activating the \emph{overlap} correction,
which successfully removed the ``chessboard'' pattern (see Figure \ref{fig:overlap} for an example).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\columnwidth]{images/m49nooverlap.eps}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\columnwidth]{images/m49overlap.eps}
\caption{Example of the \emph{overlap} correction. 
The image mosaic of the galaxy M49 was obtained by co-adding frames coming from 8 different AORs.
The evident patchiness (left image) was removed (right image) using the \emph{overlap} module.}
\label{fig:overlap}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Sigma mosaics}
For each individual cBCD frame, the IRAC Level 1 pipeline calculates the uncertainty associated to each pixel
and produces an uncertainty frame (or sigma frame).
The initial uncertainty is estimated as the Poisson noise in electrons plus the readout noise added in quadrature
($\sigma^2 = \sigma^2_{\rm readoutnoise} + \sigma^2_{\rm Poisson}$).
This initial sigma frame is carried through the pipeline, and additional uncertainties (e.g.~dark current and flat field uncertainties) 
are added in quadrature when appropriate.
When MOPEX generates an image mosaic, it also produces the associated sigma mosaic 
by interpolating the individual uncertainty frames and co-adding them,
following the standard assumption of additive variances. 

\subsubsection{Sky subtraction}
Sky subtraction was performed manually on the image mosaics using the tasks {\tt marksky} and {\tt skyfit} 
of the IRAF\footnote{IRAF is the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, 
distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, 
which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) 
under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.} 
package GALPHOT\footnote{GALPHOT was developed in the IRAF - STSDAS environment mainly by 
W. Freudling, J. Salzer, and M. P. Haynes \citep{haynes1999galphot}.}.
The task {\tt skyfit} also provided an estimate of the sky root mean square ($RMS_{\rm sky}$).
%sky value also checked with Galfit

\subsubsection{Additional aestethic corrections}
\label{sec:aesth}
The image mosaics of 4 galaxies (NGC 0821, NGC 2974, NGC 4291, NGC 4459) were found to be affected 
by bright, highly saturated stars lying close to the target galaxies.
These stars were modeled and subtracted using the software Galfit \citep{peng2010} 
and the extended IRAC Point Response Function (PRF) image at $3.6~\rm \mu m$.
This helped remove the extended wings and spikes of the saturated stars 
(see Figure \ref{fig:aesth} for an example).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\columnwidth]{images/n4459brightstar.eps}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\columnwidth]{images/n4459nobrightstar.eps}
\caption{Example of aestethic correction.
The images show the mosaic of the galaxy NGC 4459 before (left) and after (right) the partial removal 
of a bright saturated star.}
\label{fig:aesth}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Image masking}
Galactic stars and any other objects different from the target galaxy 
were masked through a two-step procedure.
First, we created an initial mask using the IRAF task 
{\tt objmasks} that identifies objects by threshold sigma detection.
Then, we refined each mask by hand, using the software 
SAOImage DS9\footnote{SAOImage DS9 development has been made possible by funding 
from the Chandra X-ray Science Center (CXC) 
and the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Center (HEASARC).} 
in conjunction with the IRAF task 
{\tt mskregions}. %\footnote{{\tt mskregions} is part of the {\tt proto} package.}.
We identified and carefully masked not only contaminating sources located in the field of the image mosaic,
but also objects overlapping with the target galaxy, such as foreground stars, background galaxies, 
globular clusters or red giant stars.

\subsubsection{1D PSF}
A universal, average, one-dimensional Point Spread Function was characterized using the IRAF task {\tt imexamine}.
A nonlinear least squares \citep{moffat1969} profile\footnote{The \citep{moffat1969} profile 
has the following form:
\begin{equation}
\mu = \mu_{\rm 0} - 2.5 \log \Biggl[ 1 + \biggl( \frac{R}{\alpha} \biggr)^2 \Biggr]^{-\beta} ,
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the projected galaxy radius, $\mu_{\rm 0}$ is the central surface brightness, and 
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ regulate the width and the shape of the profile.} 
of fixed center and zero background was fit to the 
(background subtracted) pixels of 20 bright stars, belonging to different image mosaics.
%We employed both a Gaussian and a Moffat \citep{moffat1969} profile. 
The best-fit parameters of the 20 stars were then averaged together. 
Doing so, we obtained %$FWHM = 2''.03$ for the Gaussian function,
$(\alpha, \beta) = (2''.38, 4.39)$ %for the Moffat function
(see Appendix \ref{sec:app1} for the analytical expressions of the Moffat function).

\subsubsection{2D PSF}
The IRAC support team provides users with a two-dimensional instrument Point Response Function (PRF) at $3.6~\rm \mu m$.
However, while this helped remove the extended wings of saturated stars (see Section \ref{sec:aesth}), 
we found this PRF to be inadequate for the purposes of our modelling.
In fact, the $FWHM$ of the IRAC instrument PRF ($\sim 1''.8$), as measured by the IRAF task {\tt imexamine}, 
is systematically smaller than the average $FWHM$ of ``real'' stars ($\sim 2''.0$). 
Figure \ref{fig:psf} illustrates this issue.
We also tested the IRAC PRF by providing it as the input Point Spread Function (PSF) for Galfit 
and fitting a number of stars in different image mosaics.
A visual inspection of the fit residuals confirmed that the IRAC instrument PRF is narrower than ``real'' point sources.
For this reason, we constructed our 2D PSF according to the following method 
(as directed by C. Peng, private communication).\\
We provided the IRAC instrument PRF as the input PSF for Galfit 
and simultaneously fit 7 bright stars (belonging to different mosaics), 
modeling the stars with Moffat profiles 
and constraining all the profiles to have the same $(\alpha, \beta)$, position angle and axis ratio.
The 2D PSF image was then obtained by taking the best fit Moffat model -- the same best-fit model for all 7 stars, by construction -- 
and convolving it with the IRAC instrument PRF.
The advantage of this method is to obtain a 2D PSF that is wider than the instrument PRF, 
but maintains the asymmetric features of the instrument PRF (e.g.~wings and spikes).
%This procedure was repeated using a Moffat profile in place of the Gaussian profile.
We then tested this 2D PSF 
on a number of stars (these stars were different from the 7 stars employed to build the 2D PSF image)
and verified that it correctly reproduces the shape of ``real'' point sources.

and of the IRAC instrument Point Response Function (PRF, top panel). 
The normalized flux is given in arbitrary units, 
and the radial distance is in units of pixel size of the IRAC detector (1 pixel = $1''.22$).
The blue solid line shows our 1D Moffat PSF model,
which has been normalized to intersect the data point with the largest flux. 
The $FWHM$ of the IRAC PRF is clearly smaller than that of a ``real'' star.

\subsection{Additional data}
\label{sec:adddata}
\subsubsection{Kinematics}
\label{sec:kinem}
A kinematical classification (slow/fast rotator) is available for 34 of our 75 galaxies 
from the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ survey \citep{atlas3dIII-MNRAS} 
and for 3 additional galaxies from \citet{scott2014}.
This classification (Table \ref{tab:sample}, column 7) 
concerns the kinematic properties of galaxies within the spectroscopic instrument's field-of-view, 
but does not contain additional information -- crucial for our analysis -- about kinematic substructures, 
such as embedded disks or kinematically decoupled components, 
which can require separate modeling.
For this reason, we also visually inspected the velocity fields of our galaxies, 
when available from the literature.
Velocity maps were taken from the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ survey for 34 galaxies 
(observed with SAURON by \citealt{krajnovic2011}),
from \citet{scott2014} for 2 galaxies 
(observed with WiFeS)
and from the SLUGGS survey for 12 galaxies 
(observed with DEIMOS by \citealt{arnold2014}).
While the field-of-views of SAURON ($33'' \times 41''$) and WiFeS ($25'' \times 38''$) 
reach to about one galaxy effective radius (for our local galaxies),
observations taken with DEIMOS can probe the galaxy kinematics well beyond two effective radii.

\subsubsection{AGNs and nuclear dust}
The X-ray, UV and optical radiation 
emitted by the the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) can stimulate infrared thermal emission 
from circumnuclear dust, if present. 
This means that if a galaxy hosts an optical AGN \emph{and} a certain amount of nuclear dust,
we may detect some non-stellar nuclear emission at $3.6~\rm \mu m$.
It is therefore important to identify which of our galaxies have both an optical AGN and circumnuclear dust.
To help with this task, we searched NED\footnote{NED is the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database.} 
for the individual galaxies and their associated literature.
Unsurprisingly, dusty AGNs were more frequently found in late-type spiral galaxies, 
and modelled by us with either a point source or a PSF-convolved Gaussian.

\subsubsection{S\'ersic/core-S\'ersic classification}
\label{sec:corser}
Core-S\'ersic galaxies \citep{grahamguzman2003,graham2003coresersicmodel,trujillo2004coresersicmodel} are galaxies (or bulges) 
with partially depleted cores, 
i.e.~a central deficit of light relative to the inward extrapolation of their outer S\'ersic light profile. 
Such deficits were first noted and researched by \cite{kingminkowski1966}.
S\'ersic galaxies, instead, do not exhibit such central stellar deficits.
Partially depleted cores, as measured from high-resolution observations, have typical sizes of a few tens of parsecs
\citep{dullograham2013cores,rusli2013}.
The majority are thus unresolved in our image mosaics. 
We masked these unresolved cores (identified in high-resolution images, see Table \ref{tab:sample}) by excluding the surface brightness profile 
within 3 PSF's $FWHM$ from the galaxy center.
In case of cores with sizes exceeding the PSF's $FWHM$, we excluded the data points within the size of the core 
plus 3 PSF's $FWHM$.
The S\'ersic/core-S\'ersic classification presented in this work (Table \ref{tab:sample}, column 5)
comes from the compilation of \citet{savorgnangraham2014},
who identified partially depleted cores according to the same criteria used by \citet{grahamscott2013}.
When no high-resolution image analysis was available from the literature, 
they inferred the presence of a partially depleted core based on the stellar velocity dispersion, $\sigma$:
a galaxy is classified as core-S\'ersic if $\sigma > 270\rm~km~s^{-1}$,
or as S\'ersic if $\sigma < 166\rm~km~s^{-1}$.
This resulted in us assigning cores to just 2 galaxies using this alternative method when 
no high resolution image was available.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:anal}
\subsection{Isophotal analysis}
We performed an isophotal analysis of our galaxies using the IRAF task {\tt ellipse} \citep{taskellipse}, 
which fits elliptical isophotes to galaxy images.
The center of the isophotes was held fixed, while the ellipticity ($\epsilon$), the position angle ($P.A.$),  
and the amplitude of the fourth harmonic\footnote{The amplitude of the fourth harmonic deviations from perfect ellipses 
($B4$) parameterizes the diskyness ($B4>0$) or boxyness ($B4<0$) of the isophotes.} ($B4$) were allowed to vary with radius.
The step in semi-major axis length between successive ellipses was first set to increase linearly, 
and then geometrically in our second run\footnote{In the case of linear steps, 
the semi-major axis length for the next ellipse was calculated by adding $1$ pixel to the current length.
In the case of geometric steps, the semi-major axis length for the next ellipse 
was calculated as $1.1$ times the current length.}.
As a result, for each galaxy we produced respectively a ``linearly sampled'' and a ``logarithmically sampled'' 
surface brightness profile along the major-axis. 
Major-axis surface brightness profiles were additionally converted into the equivalent-axis,
i.e.~the geometric mean of the major ($a$) and minor ($b$) axis ($R_{\rm eq} = \sqrt{ab}$), 
equivalent to the circularized radius.
This resulted in 4 profiles per galaxy.
Isophotes corresponding to an intensity less than 
three times the root mean square of the sky background fluctuations ($3 \times RMS_{\rm sky}$) were ignored.
Some surface brightness profiles were truncated at our discretion before the $3 \times RMS_{\rm sky}$ limit, 
according to specific technical reasons (e.g.~contamination from light of a neighboring galaxy, 
disturbed morphology in the galaxy outskirts, etc.).
Individual cases are discussed in Section \ref{sec:indgal}.

\subsection{Unsharp masking}
Unsharp masking is an image sharpening technique that is useful to reveal asymmetric structures in galaxies, 
such as bars or (inclined) embedded disks. 
First, the original galaxy image was smoothed with a Gaussian filter.
Then, the original image was divided by the smoothed one. 
The result of such an operation is the ``unsharp mask''. 
The asymmetric features revealed by this technique have sizes 
comparable to the $FWHM$ of the Gaussian kernel used for the smoothing.
Therefore, for each galaxy, we produced a set of different unsharp masks by varying the $FWHM$ of the filter,
to identify all the asymmetric features that could bias the fitting process 
and may therefore need to be considered during the galaxy modelling phase.
This information was used in combination with kinematic and AGN information discussed in Section \ref{sec:adddata}.

\subsection{1D fitting routine}
The decomposition of the surface brightness profiles was performed with software written by G. Savorgnan.
This software can fit an observed surface brightness profile with any linear combination of 
a set of analytical functions (S\'ersic, exponential, Gaussian, Moffat, Ferrer, symmetric Gaussian ring etc. 
see Appendix \ref{sec:app1} for a description of the analytical form of these profiles).
At each iteration, 
the model is numerically convolved with a Moffat filter, to account for PSF effects, 
and then matched to the data.
The minimization routine is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
During the fit, we deliberately did not make use of any weighting scheme on the data points that constitute the 
surface brightness profile, 
although the use of a linearly and logarithmically sampled profile effectively represents a different weighting scheme.
The all too often over-looked {\bf ??} with (signal-to-noise)-based weighting schemes 
is that they immediately become an incorrectly biased weighting schemes when additional components are present but not modelled.
For example, fitting a S\'ersic model to what is actually a nucleated elliptical galaxy immediately {\bf ??} 
a (signal-to-noise)-based weighting scheme 
and results in S\'ersic parameters which describe the bulge less accurately than had no (signal-to-noise)-weighting been used.
While we have paid careful attention to the components in each galaxy, 
and more so than the studies upon which our work is building from,
this is an issue that warrants the non application of (signal-to-noise)-based weighting schemes.
What is best in theory is not always best in practice -- in this case, because theory does not allow for unknown additional components
that are modelled.


\subsection{Smoothing technique}
\label{sec:smooth}
Some nearby galaxies in our sample have very large apparent sizes 
and for them we obtained surface brightness profiles more extended than $8~\rm arcmin$.
This means that their outermost (significant) isophote 
corresponds to a projected galactic radius $R$ 
of more than $240$ times the $FWHM$ of the instrumental PSF.
Such level of spatial resolution is unnecessary for the purposes of our analysis 
and, especially in the case of a clumpy star forming galaxy, 
it results in a ``noisy'' surface brightness profile.
Moreover, in the case of a linearly sampled light profile,
it significantly prolongs the computational time of the fitting routine 
(because, at each iteration, the PSF convolution is performed numerically on a large array).
To overcome this problem, we introduced a method to which we refer as the ``smoothing technique''.
This method was applied to the galaxies M31, M81, NGC 4945 and NGC 5128.
For each of these galaxies, we took the image mosaic and we convolved it with a Gaussian filter 
whose $FWHM$ was larger than the $FWHM$ of the instrumental PSF.
We then ran {\tt ellipse} on the convolved image and extracted 
``linearly sampled'' and ``logarithmically sampled'' surface brightness profiles. 
For the ``linearly sampled'' profiles, we set the radial step between contiguous isophotes to be 
comparable to the $FWHM$ of the smoothing Gaussian filter.
Doing so, we reduced the number of fitted isophotes and we also produced smoother surface brightness profiles.
Before the software fit a smoothed light profile, the model to be fit was convolved twice:
the first time to account for PSF effects, 
and the second time to account for the artificial Gaussian smoothing applied to the image mosaic.

\subsection{Identifying and modeling sub-components}
\label{sec:cpts}
In this Section we give a general overview of the guidelines that we followed to identify and model 
the sub-components that constitute our galaxies. 
However, given the level of accuracy and detail to which each galaxy decomposition has been performed in our analysis,
it is hard to encompass all aspects of this matter in a few paragraphs.
The modeling of each galaxy represented a particular and original problem, 
and we remand the reader to Section \ref{sec:indgal},
where we provide individual descriptions of the galaxies that we analyzed. \\
As stressed in Section \ref{sec:int}, our investigation is primarily focused on the central spheroidal components 
of galaxies.
We assumed \emph{a priori} that each of our galaxies has a unique spheroidal component, 
that we modeled with a S\'ersic profile. \\
Disks were usually fit with the exponential model, 
although in the case of highly inclined or edge-on systems we preferred using an $n < 1$ S\'ersic function. 
\citet{pastrav2013a,pastrav2013b} showed that, due to projection effects, their simulated images of inclined galaxy disks 
are better fit by a S\'ersic function with $n < 1$ than by a pure exponential model.
The inclined, embedded disks of some ``elliptical'' galaxies were described with Ferrer functions, rather than a $n < 1$ S\'ersic function. 
This choice was partly motivated by the fact that a S\'ersic + Ferrer model is less degenerate than a S\'ersic + S\'ersic model, 
since the S\'ersic profile can assume any concave ($n > 1$) or convex ($n < 1$) curvature, 
whereas the Ferrer profile can only have a negative curvature as required for an inclined disk. \\
The presence of large-scale disks, such as those of lenticular and spiral galaxies, 
were known \emph{a priori} from the galaxy morphological classification (as listed on NED), 
although some of them were re-classified by us as having intermediate-scale embedded disks.
These were identified in a number of different ways. 
If highly inclined, they can obviously be spotted from the galaxy image or the unsharp mask.
Local maxima in the ellipticity and fourth harmonic profiles 
can provide footprints of less obvious embedded disks.
In particular, the ellipticity profile helps distinguish embedded disks from large-scale disks.
Galaxy disks typically have fixed ellipticity, reflecting their inclination to our line of sight.
On the other hand, spheroids can have their ellipticities varying with radius,
but they are usually rounder than inclined disks, thus their average ellipticities are lower than those of inclined disks.
If the ellipticity profile of a galaxy increases with radius, 
this can be ascribed to an inclined disk that becomes progressively more important over the spheroid,
whereas a radial decrease of ellipticity signifies the opposite case.
Therefore, in a situation where a disk is identified from the galaxy image, 
but its extent (large- or intermediate-scale) is ambiguous,
the shape of the ellipticity profile can be decisive. 
Another way to establish the presence of an embedded disk is to look at the velocity map of a galaxy,
following the approach of \citet{arnold2014}. 
A local angular momentum decrease with increasing radius is indicative of an intermediate-scale disk 
that fades toward larger radii. \\
%As an illustration, we consider the galaxy NGC 3377.
%For this galaxy, \citet{arnold2014} reported a strong decline in local specific angular momentum beyond $\sim 35''$, 
%with a disk-to-bulge transition occurring at about $\sim 50''$.
%They did attempt a three-component decomposition (accounting for a bulge, an embedded disk and a central cusp), 
%but unfortunately they fit the spheroidal component with a limited two-parameter $R^{1/4}$ profile {\bf TBD: cite de vaucouleurs} 
%rather than a three-parameter $R^{1/n}$ S\'ersic function.
%Here we used a surface brightness profile twice as extended as that used by \citet{arnold2014} 
%and we identified a nuclear disk and an intermediate-scale disk, both embedded in a larger spheroidal component (see Figure \ref{fig:n3377ex}).
%The presence of an intermediate-scale disk is evident from the unsharp mask of the image mosaic 
%and also from the ellipticity profile, which increases with increasing radius until $R \sim 45''$ (along the major-axis) 
%and dramatically drops at larger radii.
%The nuclear disk can be spotted from the peak at $R \sim 5''$ in the $B4$ profile.
%In our galaxy model for NGC 3377, 
%the difference between the S\'ersic profile of the bulge and the exponential profile of the intermediate-scale disk is minimum in correspondence 
%of the maximum ellipticity, 
%thus our model correctly reproduces the isophotal properties of the galaxy. 
%The residuals of the fit, especially along the major-axis, display some minor structures which indicate that 
%the bulge S\'ersic index might have been slightly overestimated.
%This could be due to the fact that the embedded disk would be better described by a truncated exponential function.
%Alternatively, a contribution from a stellar halo (not included in our model) at large radii could be the reason of a 
%too large S\'ersic index for the bulge. 
%Our equivalent-axis decomposition results in a bulge component that accounts for 94\% of the total luminosity, 
%an intermediate-scale embedded disk contributing to 5\% 
%and a nuclear disk with 1\% of the total light. \\
%A similar situation occurs for the galaxy M59 (see Figure \ref{fig:m59ex}), 
%for which our equivalent-axis model returns a spheroidal component and an embedded disk 
%contributing to 92\% and 8\% of the total light respectively. \\
%The edge-on embedded disk of the S\'ersic galaxy NGC 1332 (see Figure \ref{fig:n1332ex}) was hard to model with an exponential function, 
%leading us to prefer a low-$n$ S\'ersic profile. 
%Our equivalent-axis decomposition returns a spheroidal component accounting for 95\% of the total light,
%and an embedded disk accounting for the remaining 5\%.
%In passing, we note that the bulge-disk decomposition performed by \citet{rusli2011} on NGC 1332 
%is significantly different from our best-fit model.
%\citet{rusli2011} did not identify an intermediate-scale embedded disk, 
%but instead proposed a model featuring a S\'ersic bulge ($n \sim 2.3$, $R_{\rm e} \sim 8''$), accounting for 43\% of the total light, 
%and a large-scale exponential disk. 
%This result led them to the conclusion that NGC 1332 is a disk dominated lenticular galaxy 
%and is displaced from the $M_{\rm BH} - L_{\rm K,sph}$ (black hole mass vs. $K$-band spheroid luminosity) relation of \citet{marconihunt2003} 
%by an order of magnitude along the $M_{\rm BH}$ direction.
%Assuming instead that, as suggested by our model, 
%the galaxy spheroid is a factor of two more luminous than what claimed by \citet{rusli2011}, 
%NGC 1332 would no longer be an outlier in the $M_{\rm BH} - L_{\rm K,sph}$ diagram (see Figure \ref{fig:n1332pl}), 
%perfectly fitting within the $1\sigma$ scatter of the $M_{\rm BH} - L_{\rm K,sph}$ relation for S\'ersic bulges of \citet{grahamscott2013}. \\
Bars are usually recognizable from galaxy images and unsharp masks, 
although local maxima/minima or abrupt changes in the radial profiles of the isophotal parameters 
can provide additional evidence for less obvious bars. 
As noted, we were able to successfully fit bars with a Ferrer function or a low-$n$ S\'ersic model ($n \sim 0.2$). \\
The presence of a nuclear component -- either resolved or unresolved -- was generally expected in 
(but not restricted to) galaxies that host an optical AGN and circumnuclear dust.
Nuclear stellar disks and nuclear star clusters fall into the category of nuclear components too,
but their identification can be more subtle than for AGNs.
Nuclear clusters have typical sizes of a few parsecs, 
therefore for the majority of our galaxies they are unresolved in \emph{Spitzer}/IRAC $3.6~\rm \mu m$ observations.
If an identification from high-resolution observations was available from the literature, we relied on that, 
otherwise we concluded that a galaxy was nucleated from an excess of nuclear light in the residuals of the 
fit\footnote{This conclusion was drawn after going through the following steps. 
First we identified all the sub-components of a galaxy 
(assuming that the galaxy was not nucleated), built a model accordingly and fit it to the data.
If the residuals of the fit showed a nuclear light excess, 
we repeated the fit by excluding the data points within the nuclear region.
Only after checking that the outcome of the last fit was consistent with a fit that included a small nuclear component, 
we inferred the presence of a stellar nuclear component.}.
Unresolved nuclear components were fit with our optimal Moffat PSF,
whereas resolved nuclear components were modeled with (PSF-convolved) narrow Gaussian functions. \\
Rings were identified from galaxy images and unsharp masks, and modeled with symmetric Gaussian ring profiles. \\
As an illustration, we consider the galaxy NGC 2974, 
a spiral galaxy which has been misclassified as an elliptical galaxy in the RC3 catalog \citep{RC3}. 
This galaxy hosts a Seyfert AGN \citep{veroncettyveron2006} and filamentary dust in its center \citep{tran2001}.
NGC 2974 is classified as a fast rotator by the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ survey, 
and indeed the velocity map obtained by the SLUGGS survey shows that the galaxy kinematics is rotation-dominated 
well beyond three effective radii ($R>150''$), 
as expected from a large-scale disk. 
%\cite{sani2011} modeled this galaxy with a S\'ersic-bulge + Gaussian-AGN 
%($R_{\rm e} = 27''.2$, $n = 3.0$). 
From an inspection of the unsharp mask, we identified a ring at $R \sim 50''$, 
which might be a residual of two tightly wound spiral arms,
and an elongated bar-like component within $R \lesssim 30''$,
that is in addition to the more spherical bulge 
and produces a peak in the ellipticity and position angle profiles at $R \sim 20''$.
Our 1D galaxy decomposition for NGC 2974 (Figure \ref{fig:n2974ex}) consists of a S\'ersic bulge, an exponential large-scale disk,
a Ferrer bar, a Gaussian nuclear component (AGN) and a Gaussian ring.
Although the ring is extremely faint, it is important to account for it in the galaxy decomposition. 
A model without the ring component results in a ``steeper'' exponential profile for the disk 
(i.e.~the exponential model has a smaller scale length and a brighter central surface brightness) 
and produces bad residual structures within $R \lesssim 40''$.
Our best-fit model returns a $3.6~\rm \mu m$ bulge major-axis effective radius $R_{\rm e,sph}^{\rm maj} = 8.3\rm~arcsec$, 
equivalent-axis S\'ersic index $n_{\rm sph}^{\rm eq} = 1.2$ and apparent magnitude $m_{\rm sph} = 8.65~\rm mag$.
\cite{sani2011} modeled NGC 2974 with a S\'ersic bulge and a Gaussian nuclear component (AGN), 
but did not account for the large-scale disk.
From their best-fit 2D model, they obtained a three times larger 
$3.6~\rm \mu m$ bulge major-axis effective radius ($R_{\rm e,sph}^{\rm maj} = 27.2\rm~arcsec$), 
a 2.5 times larger S\'ersic index ($n_{\rm sph} = 3$),
and a significantly brighter apparent magnitude ($m_{\rm sph} = 7.28~\rm mag$).

\subsection{2D fits}
\label{sec:2d}
Two-dimensional decompositions were carried out using the software \textsc{Imfit} \citep{imfit}.
For each galaxy, we built a 2D model that was consistent with the corresponding 1D model in terms of number and type of components. 
Because the Ferrer profile is not made available in \textsc{Imfit},
bars were fit with a 2D Gaussian function. \\
The 2D decomposition of NGC 2974 is presented in Figure \ref{fig:n29742d}. 
The galaxy was modeled with a S\'ersic bulge, an exponential disk and a Gaussian bar.
The nuclear component was masked and the ring was not 
modeled\footnote{We built the 2D model first including and then omitting a gaussian ring component, 
but both models converged to the same solution, i.e.~the fit ``ignored'' the presence of the faint ring. 
This did not happen in the 1D decomposition because of the different weighting scheme used by the fitting routines.}. 
Our best-fit 2D model returns a bulge major-axis effective radius $R_{\rm e,sph}^{\rm maj} = 10.5~\rm arcsec$, 
a bulge S\'ersic index $n_{\rm sph} = 1.3$ and a $3.6~\rm \mu m$ bulge apparent magnitude $m_{\rm sph} = 8.39~\rm mag$, 
in fairly good agreement with our 1D decomposition. 
Fits and descriptions for the other galaxies are available online.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}
For each galaxy, after we identified its various components and built a model accordingly, 
we simultaneously performed a set of four 1D fits.
All four fits use a Moffat-convolved model.
Two fits use the major-axis surface brightness profile and the remaining two use the equivalent-axis surface brightness profile. 
For each of these pairs, we use a logarithmically sampled surface brightness profile 
and a linearly sampled surface brightness profile. 
Because our fitting routine intentionally does not employ an error weighting scheme on the data points that constitute the surface brightness profile, 
a fit to a logarithmically sampled profile puts more weight on the inner region of the galaxy 
and poorly constrains the outskirts.
On the other hand, a fit to a linearly sampled surface brightness profile equally treats inner and outer regions, 
but is more susceptible to sky-background subtraction issues. \\ 
We found that the fits are, in general, more sensitive to the choice of the initial parameters 
when using logarithmically sampled profiles than linearly sampled profiles. 
In addition, a visual examination of the residuals revealed that the quality of the fit within one galaxy effective radius 
is superior when tighter constraints are put on the galaxy outskirts.
In other words, the better quality of the residuals led us to prefer the fits that use linearly sampled surface brightness profiles,
although the results were ususally very similar,as might be expected. \\
Among the initial sample of 75 galaxies, we did not attempt to model 3 galaxies: M32, NGC 4486A and the Circinus Galaxy. 
The first two... {\bf AL: can you write a short sentence about these 2 galaxies, that have uncertain morphology,
because they have been stripped, blah blah, maybe put one reference? please and thank you.}
The Circinus Galaxy lies at only 4 degrees from the Galactic Plane, 
therefore its image mosaic is contaminated by a large number of foreground stars.
Of the remaining 72 galaxies, 
we obtained satisfactory 1D decompositions for 66, 
whereas the models of 6 galaxies were judged not reliable and were thus excluded. 
We also performed reliable 2D decompositions for 31 galaxies. \\
A galaxy-by-galaxy comparison between our best-fit models and those from the previous literature 
helped identify the optimal decompositions and past problems. 
We compared our best-fit models with those of \cite{grahamdriver2007}, \cite{sani2011}, \cite{beifiori2012}, 
\cite{vika2012} and \cite{lasker2014data}. 
We also considered the best-fit models of \cite{laurikainen2010} and \cite{rusli2013} because,   
although they did not specifically deal with black hole -- galaxy scaling relations, 
their galaxy samples significantly overlap with ours. \\
%In Section \ref{sec:indgal} we discuss individual cases, explaining the discrepancies between different decompositions. \\
Table \ref{tab:fitres} lists the results from both the 1D and 2D fits.

\input{table_fitresults.tex}

\subsection{1D versus 2D decompositions}
Here we explore how 1D and 2D decompositions compare with each other. 
Readers not interested in our practical knowledge, 
having dealt with 1D and 2D techniques of galaxy modeling at the same time, can skip to Section \ref{sec:err}. 
We summarize our experience in the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item A visual inspection of galaxy images and their unsharp masks is often not sufficient to accurately identify all of a galaxy's components. 
Weak bars and some embedded disks can easily be missed. 
Other (inclined) embedded disks can be confused with large-scale disks.
In this regards, the 1D isophotal analysis is extremely helpful. 
Local minima/maxima or abrupt changes in the ellipticity, position angle and fourth harmonic profiles contain precious information 
about a galaxy's constituents.
\item The ellipticity and position angle of triaxial bulges can vary with radius.
The analytic functions used by 2D decomposition codes to fit galaxy components have fixed ellipticity and position angle, 
thus they cannot account for these radial gradients. 
This problem is overcome with 1D decomposition techniques.
\item The interpretation of the residual surface brightness profile is often crucial to identify the optimal decomposition for a galaxy. 
In our experience, we found that interpreting 1D residuals was easier and more productive than 2D residuals.
\end{itemize}
Although we attempted 2D modeling for the 72 galaxies in our sample, 
more than half of the 2D decompositions were not successful or did not converge to a meaningful solution. 
This should serve as a tip to users of 2D fitting codes. 
When physically meaningful bulge parameters are required, 
the output may not be reliable and should be inspected.
For the 31 galaxies that had successful 2D decompositions, 
we compare with their 1D parameters in Figures \ref{fig:re1d2d}, \ref{fig:n1d2d} and \ref{fig:mag1d2d}.
%The software \textsc{Imfit} returns major-axis measurements of effective radii, 
%which are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:re1d2d} versus the corresponding 1D major-axis measurements.
%2D measurements of S\'ersic indices can be approximated to 1D equivalent-axis measurements, 
%and are therefore compared to them in Figure \ref{fig:n1d2d}.
%Figure \ref{fig:mag1d2d} shows 2D versus 1D measurements of bulge magnitudes. 
The agreement between 1D and 2D effective radii and magnitudes is remarkable, 
whereas a larger amount of scatter in the S\'ersic indices can be caused by the fact that 
2D measurements do not exactly correspond to 1D equivalent-axis measurements. 
No systematic effects are observed in any of these three plots, 
which indicates that 1D and 2D techniques of galaxy modeling -- when performed on the same galaxy -- 
can give consistent results. \\
In conclusion, since we found that the best-fit parameters do not depend on the decomposition method (1D or 2D) used, 
and given that we obtained more successful 1D decompositions than 2D, 
we will base our analysis on the results from the 1D fits.

\subsection{Parameter uncertainty}
\label{sec:err}
Estimating the uncertainties associated with the best-fit parameters of our 1D galaxy decompositions is not straightforward.
Monte Carlo simulations could be used for this purpose, 
but they would take into account only random errors and not unknown systematic errors.
Systematic errors include incorrect sky subtraction, 
inaccurate masking of contaminating sources, 
imprecise description of the PSF, 
erroneous choice of model components 
(for example, when failing to identify a galaxy sub-component and thus omitting it in the model, 
or when describing a galaxy sub-component with an inadequate function),
the radial extent of the surface brightness profile and its sampling.
These factors are not included in popular 2D fitting codes which report only the random errors associated with their fitted parameters.  
Moreover, when performing multi-component decomposition of high signal-to-noise images of nearby -- therefore well resolved -- galaxies, 
errors are dominated by systematics rather than Poisson noise.
For this reason, we decided to estimate the uncertainties of the bulge best-fit parameters 
with a method that took into account systematic errors. 

\subsubsection{Goodness of the bulge modeling}
For each of our fits, we calculated the associated $RMS$ scatter using:
\begin{equation}
\Delta = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\rm i=0}^{N} (\mu_{\rm i}^{\rm obs} - \mu_{\rm i}^{\rm mod})^2}{N_{\rm DOF}} } ,
\end{equation} 
where $N_{\rm DOF}$ is the number of degrees-of-freedom, 
$\mu_{\rm i}^{\rm obs}$ is the observed surface brightness 
and $\mu_{\rm i}^{\rm mod}$ is the model surface brightness at each data point $i$.
Although useful to evaluate the overall quality of a galaxy decomposition, 
the $RMS$ scatter alone cannot be used to assess the goodness of the fit for the spheroidal component only, 
unless the galaxy is a pure spheroid and has consequently been modeled with a single S\'ersic profile.
To illustrate this point with an example, 
one can imagine a situation in which a galaxy is thought to be made of a small bulge and a much more extended disk.
This galaxy is decomposed with a S\'ersic + exponential model.
The exponential function provides an excellent description of the light profile of the disk, 
whereas the S\'ersic function does not do the same for the bulge.
The residuals of the fit will then be flat and close to zero at large radii, 
where the emission of the disk dominates over that of the bulge,
while they will display significant departures at small radii, 
in correspondence with the poorly fit spheroidal component.
In the case of linear sampling, 
because the part of the surface brightness profile pertaining to the disk may contain more data points 
than the part pertaining to the bulge, 
the global $RMS$ scatter will be relatively small, 
but it obviously will not reflect the accuracy of the fit to the spheroidal component only. \\
A simple but powerful way to get a feeling of how precisely the global model and its spheroidal component have fared
is to look at the major- and equivalent-axis fits of each galaxy 
and visually inspect the structures of the residual surface brightness profile 
(i.e.~the second row in Figure \ref{fig:n2974ex}) within $\sim 1 - 2$ bulge effective radii. 
We did this using a grade from 1 to 3, assigned according to the following criteria.
\begin{itemize}
\item [1)] A grade of 1 was given to the best fits, i.e.~fits that do not exhibit any of the problems listed below.
\item [2)] A grade of 2 was issued in the following cases. 
The residuals in correspondence with the radial extent of the bulge component are not randomly distributed around zero, 
being symptomatic of a S\'ersic model having a curvature (regulated by the S\'ersic index $n$) 
that does not quite match the real ``shape'' of the bulge. 
When we identified, but were not able to accurately model. a galaxy sub-component.
In the case of apparent inconsistencies between the model and the observed galaxy properties 
(e.g.~an embedded disk modeled with an exponential function, 
whose scale length does not quite match the size of the disk as expected from the ellipticity profile or the velocity map).
When the S\'ersic model used to describe the bulge component has a size -- as measured by the effective radius -- 
comparable to a few times the $FWHM$ of the PSF.
Galaxies in this category are reasonably well fit despite these issues.
\item [3)] A grade of 3 was assigned to the poorer and more anomalous fits, 
or those affected by an obvious degeneracy between the bulge S\'ersic profile and the remaining model components 
(e.g.~when the bulge S\'ersic index varies by as much as 50\% among the four different realizations of the fit, 
or when the output of the fit strongly depends on the choice of the initial parameters).
\end{itemize}
As a result, we classified 27 galaxies (38\% of the 72 galaxies for which we attempted a 1D decomposition) with grade 1, 
29 galaxies (40\%) with grade 2 and 10 galaxies (14\%) with grade 3.
Six galaxies could not be modelled.
We report the assigned grades in Table \ref{tab:fitres} (column 10).

\subsubsection{Uncertainties on $n_{\rm sph}$}
%\label{sec:sigman}
In Figure \ref{fig:compn}, for 58 galaxies, 
we compare the measurements of the bulge S\'ersic index obtained by different authors 
with those obtained by us. 
For each galaxy, we computed the average value $\langle \log(n_{\rm sph}) \rangle$ of the available measurements, 
and we plot it against the scatter of the individual measurements around each spheroid's $\langle \log(n_{\rm sph}) \rangle$.
The measurements are heterogeneous, 
in the sense that they were obtained from 1D or 2D decompositions of data in different wavelengths, 
and they refer either to the major-axis, the equivalent-axis or some 2D average.
In Figure \ref{fig:compn}, the black histogram shows the distribution of the scatter around $\langle \log(n_{\rm sph}) \rangle$ 
for our measurements. 
38\% of this distribution lie within $-\sigma_1^- = -0.08~\rm dex$ and $+\sigma_1^+ = +0.06~\rm dex$, 
78\% lie within $-\sigma_2^- = -0.21~\rm dex$ and $+\sigma_2^+ = +0.17~\rm dex$,
and 92\% lie within $-\sigma_3^- = -0.25~\rm dex$ and $+\sigma_3^+ = +0.25~\rm dex$. 
We elect to use $\pm \sigma_1^\pm$, $\pm \sigma_2^\pm$ and $\pm \sigma_3^\pm$ as $1\sigma$ uncertainties 
for our measurements of $\log(n_{\rm sph})$ obtained from ``grade 1'', ``grade 2'' and ``grade 3'' fits, respectively. \\

\subsubsection{Uncertainties on $R_{\rm e,sph}$}
The uncertainties on the bulge effective radii were computed using the same methodology as employed for the S\'ersic indices. 
However, in Figure \ref{fig:compre} we include only major-axis measurements of $R_{\rm e,sph}$. 
The associated $1\sigma$ uncertainties for our measurements of $\log(R_{\rm e,sph})$ are 
$-\sigma_1^- = -0.11~\rm dex$ and $+\sigma_1^+ = +0.07~\rm dex$, 
$-\sigma_2^- = -0.30~\rm dex$ and $+\sigma_2^+ = +0.32~\rm dex$,
and $-\sigma_3^- = -0.39~\rm dex$ and $+\sigma_3^+ = +0.42~\rm dex$. 

\subsubsection{Uncertainties on $m_{\rm sph}$}
To estimate the uncertainties on the bulge magnitudes, 
we compared (see Figure \ref{fig:compmag}) only those literature measurements coming from $K$-band or $3.6~\rm \mu m$ observations.
To do this, the $3.6~\rm \mu m$ magnitudes were converted into $K$-band magnitudes by applying an additive factor of $0.27\rm~mag$, 
which was estimated using the stellar population models of \cite{worthey1994},
assuming a 13 Gyr old single-burst stellar population with solar metallicity. 
The associated $1\sigma$ uncertainties for our measurements of $m_{\rm sph}$ are 
$-\sigma_1^- = -0.11~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_1^+ = +0.18~\rm mag$, 
$-\sigma_2^- = -0.58~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_2^+ = +0.66~\rm mag$,
and $-\sigma_3^- = -0.66~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_3^+ = +0.88~\rm mag$. 

\subsubsection{Uncertainties on $\mu_{\rm e,sph}$}
As for the bulge magnitudes, we estimated the uncertainties on the bulge effective surface brightnesses $\mu_{\rm e,sph}$ 
by comparing only $K$-band or $3.6~\rm \mu m$ measurements (see Figure \ref{fig:compmue}), 
and accounting for the mean color difference of $0.27\rm~mag$. 
Not explicitly reported in the literature, effective surface brightnesses were calculated by us using:
\begin{multline}
\mu_{\rm e,sph} = m_{\rm sph} + 5\log \Bigl(R_{\rm e,sph}^{\rm maj}\sqrt{(b/a)_{\rm sph}} \Bigr) + \\
+ 2.5\log \Bigl[2\pi n_{\rm sph} e^{b_n} b_n^{-2n_{\rm sph}} \Gamma(2n_{\rm sph})\Bigr], 
\end{multline}
where $b_n$ and $\Gamma(2n_{\rm sph})$ are defined in the Appendix, 
and $(b/a)_{\rm sph}$ is the bulge axis ratio.
While \cite{laurikainen2010} and \cite{sani2011} reported their estimates of $(b/a)_{\rm sph}$, 
\cite{vika2012} and \cite{lasker2014data} did not. 
For the last two studies, we used the values of $(b/a)_{\rm sph}$ reported by \cite{sani2011}.
The associated $1\sigma$ uncertainties for our measurements of $\mu_{\rm e,sph}$ are 
$-\sigma_1^- = -0.33~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_1^+ = +0.57~\rm mag$, 
$-\sigma_2^- = -0.84~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_2^+ = +1.59~\rm mag$,
and $-\sigma_3^- = -1.06~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_3^+ = +1.74~\rm mag$. 

\subsubsection{Uncertainties on $\mu_{\rm 0,sph}$}
From the values of $\mu_{\rm e,sph}$, we derived the central surface brightnesses $\mu_{\rm 0,sph}$ from the equation
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rm 0,sph} = \mu_{\rm e,sph} - \frac{2.5 b_n}{\ln(10)}.
\end{equation}
The associated $1\sigma$ uncertainties for our measurements of $\mu_{\rm 0,sph}$ are 
$-\sigma_1^- = -0.20~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_1^+ = +0.64~\rm mag$, 
$-\sigma_2^- = -0.70~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_2^+ = +1.24~\rm mag$,
and $-\sigma_3^- = -1.05~\rm mag$ and $+\sigma_3^+ = +1.57~\rm mag$.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}
The widespread presence of embedded components -- such as intermediate-scale disks -- in massive early-type galaxies 
makes galaxy decomposition an essential tool to properly investigate the scaling relations between black hole masses 
and host bulge properties. \\
Past studies often used different models for the same galaxy, and obtained significantly discrepant results,  
which led them to draw contrasting conclusions about the black hole--bulge correlations.
These inconsistencies motivated our effort to secure and refine the measure of bulge properties in a sample of 75 galaxies 
with a dynamical estimate of the black hole mass. 
Using $3.6~\rm \mu m$ \emph{Spitzer} satellite imagery, 
we performed state-of-the-art galaxy decompositions. 
The $3.6~\rm \mu m$ band is an excellent tracer of the stellar mass, superior to optical bands or the $K$-band. 
Considerable care has been taken in the data reduction, image mosaicking, sky subtraction and component model fitting to the galaxy light.
We have compared our best-fit models with those from the literature, 
to identify and explain discrepancies when present. 
Our analysis additionally benefited from recourse to kinematical information -- not previously used -- to aid the identification of 
somewhat face-on disks, or the distinction between intermediate-scale disks and large-scale disks, 
missed in some past investigations and decompositions.
Table \ref{tab:lit} summarizes the main characteristics of the five past studies that, since 2007, attempted galaxy decomposition 
to derive black hole-bulge scaling relations, 
and highlights, in part, why our endeavor represents a substantial improvement over the past literature.

\begin{itemize}
\item One-dimensional and two-dimensional techniques of galaxy decomposition return the same results when applied to the same galaxy.
However, in our practical experience, two-dimensional decompositions {\bf HOW DO YOU WRITE THIS IN ENGLISH?? fail twice as much as one-dimensional ones}, 
either because the fit does not converge or because the result is unphysical. 
A strong limitation of two-dimensional codes is their inability to accommodate the radial gradients of ellipticity and position angle 
often observed in galaxy bulges.
\item We found the interpretation of one-dimensional residual surface brightness profiles easier than that of two-dimensional residual images. 
A correct interpretation of the residuals is fundamental to determine the optimal model for a galaxy.
\item A one-dimensional isophotal analysis was extremely helpful and sometimes even necessary to accurately identify galaxy components.
\item Given the level of detail to which each galaxy decomposition was performed, 
we believe that our analysis cannot be reproduced by current automatic routines. 
\item The uncertainties associated with the bulge best-fit parameters are dominated by systematic errors (e.g.~incorrect sky subtraction, 
inaccurate masking of contaminating sources, erroneous choice of model components), and only marginally affected by random errors. 
For this reason, we developed a method to estimate the uncertainties on the best-fit parameters that takes into account systematic errors.
\end{itemize}

We will use the results from our one-dimensional galaxy decompositions to obtain improved black hole mass scaling relations. 
We will also derive and explore some unpublished correlations. 
These results will be presented in a series of forthcoming papers.

{\bf Lasker's conclusions are: bulge+disk decompositions are not enough, we do better by adding bars, spiral arms and stuff (really?? what a surprising conclusion);
we modelled the envelope of 5 galaxies; we observed central light deficits in 9 ellipticals; total magnitudes are independent from details of modelling (no, really?)
and bulge magnitudes are 0.36 mag fainter when additional components (other than bulge and disk) are modelled.  }

  \subsection{individual galaxies}
  \label{sec:indgal}

  individual galaxies \\
  For each galaxy, we show a figure and a table. 
  The figure illustrates our 1D best-fit model and the galaxy isophotal parameters. 
  The left panels refer to the major-axis $R_{\rm maj}$, 
  while the right panels refer to the equivalent-axis $R_{\rm eq}$, 
  i.e.~the geometric mean of the major ($a$) and minor ($b$) axis ($R_{\rm eq} = \sqrt{ab}$).
  The top panels display the galaxy surface brightness ($\mu$) radial profiles obtained with a linear sampling. 
  The black points are the observed data.  
  The color lines represent the individual (PSF-convolved) model components:
  red=S\'ersic, dark blue=exponential, green=Gaussian, cyan=Ferrer, gray=Gaussian ring, pink=PSF. 
  The best-fit parameters for the S\'ersic bulge model are inset.
  The total (PSF-convolved) model is shown with a black dashed line. 
  The residual profile ($data - model$) is shown as $\Delta \mu$ in the second row.
  The horizontal grey dashed line corresponds to an intensity 
  equal to three times the root mean square of the sky background fluctuations ($3 \times RMS_{\rm sky}$).
  $\Delta$ denotes the rms scatter of the fit in units of $\rm mag~arcsec^{-2}$.
  The lower six panels show the ellipticity ($\epsilon$), position angle ($PA$) and fourth harmonic ($B4$) radial profiles. \\
  The table reports a comparison between our results (from both our 1D and 2D decompositions) and those obtained by the following authors: 
  GD07 = \citeauthor{grahamdriver2007} (\citeyear{grahamdriver2007}, who performed 1D fits along the major-axis), 
  L+10 = \citeauthor{laurikainen2010} (\citeyear{laurikainen2010}, who performed 2D fits), 
  S+11 = \citeauthor{sani2011} (\citeyear{sani2011}, who performed 2D fits), 
  B+12 = \citeauthor{beifiori2012} (\citeyear{beifiori2012}, who performed 2D fits), 
  V+12 = \citeauthor{vika2012} (\citeyear{vika2012}, who performed 2D fits), 
  R+13 = \citeauthor{rusli2013} (\citeyear{rusli2013}, who performed 1D fits along the equivalent-axis),
  and L+14 = \citeauthor{lasker2014data} (\citeyear{lasker2014data}, who performed 2D fits).
  Each galaxy model is the sum of its individual components, which are expressed with the following nomenclature: (analytic function)-(physical component).
  The analytic functions can be: S=S\'ersic, e=exponential, G=Gaussian, F=Ferrer, M=Moffat and PSF.
  The physical components can be: bul=bulge or spheroid, d=disk, id=inner disk, bar, n=nucleus, l=lens or oval, r=ring, halo and spiral arms. 
  When a nuclear component or a partially depleted core have been masked, we signal them as ``m-n'' and ``m-c'', respectively.
  For example, the model ``S-bul + e-d + e-id + m-n + G-r'' reads ``S\'ersic-bulge + exponential-disk + exponential-inner disk + mask-nucleus + Gaussian-ring''. 
  The core-S\'ersic model used by \cite{rusli2013} is always implicitly associated with the galaxy spheroidal component. 
  When fitting their galaxy light profiles, \citeauthor{grahamdriver2007} excluded the innermost data points. 
  Their models implicitly include ``m-n'' or ``m-c''. 
  In the table caption, we comment on the most significant discrepancies between our results and those obtained by the other studies.

  A visual inspection of the image of IC 2560 reveals a boxy bulge and

  The disk appears to be slightly lopsided along the direction of the bar,
  due to two non-symmetric ansae, but it becomes symmetric beyond $R_{\rm maj} \gtrsim 60''$. 
  This is why the surface brightness profile deviates from a perfect exponential
  in the radial range $42'' \lesssim R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 60''$, which is excluded from the fit.
  Motivated by the presence of a strong optical AGN and dust in the nucleus,

  L+14 obtained the largest effective radius and S\'ersic index,

  implying the need for a smaller $R_{\rm e}$ and $n$. 
  We suspect that this could be due to the pixel weighting scheme that they used.

  M31, the Andromeda galaxy, is a spiral galaxy. 
  Although for decades this galaxy had been classified as an unbarred spiral,
  recent works have unraveled the presence of a bar \citep{athanassoulabeaton2006m31,beaton2007m31,morrison2011m31}.
  M31 also features a ring-like structure at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 50'$ \citep{athanassoulabeaton2006m31}. 
  We applied the \emph{smoothing} technique described in Section \ref{sec:smooth} to the analysis of M31.
  The region $2000'' \lesssim R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 3400''$, where the pseudo-ring is observed, is excluded from the fit.
  A S\'ersic + exponential fit is not adequate to describe the light profile of M31,
  as the residuals of such fit display a structure in correspondence of the bar ($R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 1500''$).
  The addition of a Ferrer function to account for the bar notably improves the fit.

  M96 is a spiral galaxy with a large scale bar and no AGN activity \citep{martini2003,nowak2010n3368n3489}. 
  \cite{erwin2004} observed the presence of two bars in this galaxy. 
  \cite{nowak2010n3368n3489} reported the presence of a large pseudo-bulge and a tiny classical bulge 
  ($R_{\rm e, sph} = 1''.6$, $n_{\rm sph} = 2.3$). 
  However, they came to this conclusion by modeling only the innermost $8''.5$ of the 
  light profile of M96 with a S\'ersic-classical bulge and an exponential-pseudobulge, 
  but without subtracting the contribution of the large-scale disk and the large-scale bar.
  They also acknowledged the presence of a secondary inner bar, but did not include it in their fit. 
  M96 has a complex morphology. 
  The large-scale disk does not exhibit a perfect exponential profile, 
  mainly because of wound spiral arms resembling a ring ($R_{\rm maj} \sim 185''$),
  which however are too faint and irregular to be described with a Gaussian ring model. 
  The large scale bar extends out to $R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 80''$ and is modeled with a Ferrer function.
  A peak at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 25''$ in the ellipticity profile unravels an inner disky component embedded in the bulge, 
  that we model with a low-$n$ S\'ersic profile.

  component, as also noted by \cite{lasker2014data}.

  Its bar is surrounded by two tightly wound star-forming spiral arms that resemble a ring \citep{comeron2010}. 
  The bar of NGC 2273 extends out to $R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 25''$. 
  The pseudo-ring does not produce any evident swelling in the light profile, 
  therefore we do not account for it in the galaxy model.
  The isophotal parameters confirm the presence of a nuclear disky component within $R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 5''$.
  However, as noted by \cite{laurikainen2005}, any attempt to account for the embedded disk resulted in a degenerate model. 
  This is not surprising if one considers the poor spatial resolution of the galaxy image, 
  with the effective radius of the bulge comparable to the FWHM of the instrumental PSF.
  Although NGC 2273 hosts an optical AGN and nuclear dust, no central excess of light is observed in the 1D residuals.

  \caption{Best-fit model and isophotal parameters for NGC 2787.
  NGC 2787 is a barred lenticular galaxy with LINER nuclear activity \citep{veroncettyveron2006}.
  An inner disk is embedded in the bulge of this galaxy \citep{erwin2003n2787}.
  NGC 2787 features a spectacular structure of dust rings at its center \citep{erwinsparke2003}
  and a nuclear stellar disk (with size $\lesssim 1''.8$, \citealt{ledo2010}).
  NGC 2787 has an undoubtedly complex morphology. 
  This galaxy is composed of a bulge, a large scale disk, a bar (see the peaks in the ellipticity, PA and B4 profiles
  at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 30''$) with two ansae, an inner disk (or bar?) embedded in the bulge (see the peak in the ellipticity profile
  at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 17''$), and a bright nucleus.
  After masking the data affected by the ansae within $30'' \lesssim R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 50''$,
  we use a Ferrer function for the bar, a second Ferrer function for the inner disk (or bar) 
  and a PSF component for the nucleus. 
  %Beyond $R_{\rm maj} \gtrsim 50''$, where the galaxy large scale disk extends without being affected by the bar ansae,
  %the surface brightness profile is not a perfect exponential, being better described by a S\'ersic function
  %with $n < 1$.
  %Curiously, at optical wavelengths the disk has an exponential decline with no truncation or anti-truncation 
  %(see \citealt{erwin2003n2787} their Figure 14, and \citealt{erwin2008}).
  %Here we propose two different models for NGC 2787.
  %In both cases we used a S\'ersic profile for the bulge, a Ferrer function for the bar, a second Ferrer function for the inner disk (or bar) 
  %and a PSF for the nucleus. 
  %We then described the large scale disk using a S\'ersic function with $n < 1$ 
  %or an exponential function. 
  %In the last case we needed to exclude the data within $R_{\rm maj} \sim 30'' - 50''$ where the ansae produce a hollow.
  %The two different decompositions result in the same bulge best-fit parameters ($R_{\rm e} \sim 5''$, $n \sim 1$)
  %along the major-axis, whereas the outcome is significantly different along the equivalent-axis 
  %($n = 1.3$ when using the exponential-disk and $n = 2.2$ when using the S\'ersic-disk).

  \caption{Best-fit model and isophotal parameters for NGC 2974.
  NGC 2974 is a spiral galaxy which has been misclassified as an elliptical galaxy in the RC3 catalog.
  The galaxy hosts a Seyfert AGN \citep{veroncettyveron2006} and filamentary dust in its center \citep{tran2001}.
  From an inspection of the unsharp mask, we identified a ring structure at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 50''$, 
  probably a residual of two tightly wound spiral arms,
  and an elongated bar-like component within $R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 30''$, that we fit with a Ferrer function.
  The bar produces a peak in the ellipticity profile at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 20''$.
  Although the ring is extremely faint, it is important to account for it in the galaxy decomposition. 
  A model without the ring component results in a ``steeper'' exponential-disk (the disk has a smaller scale length 
  and a brighter central surface brightness) and produces bad residuals within $R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 40''$.
  The nuclear component is fit with a Gaussian profile.

  \caption{Best-fit model and isophotal parameters for NGC 3115.
  NGC 3115 is an edge-on elliptical/lenticular galaxy. 
  This galaxy features a nuclear stellar disk (with size $\sim 1''$, \citealt{scorzabender1995,ledo2010}).
  NGC 3115 has an intermediate scale disk.
  This is immediately evident by looking at the ellipticity and B4 profiles.
  Going from the galaxy center to the outskirts, the ellipticity increases until it reaches a maximum 
  ($\epsilon \sim 0.65$) at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 90''$. 
  After this point, it starts declining, being as low as $\epsilon \sim 0.55$ at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 240''$. 
  The galaxy isophotes display a positive diskyness within $R_{\rm maj} \sim 90''$, but become perfect ellipses 
  ($B4 \sim 0$) beyond that point.
  Because galaxy disks typically have fixed ellipticity, reflecting their inclination to our line of sight,
  the previous observations tell us that, going from the galaxy center to the outer regions,
  the disk of NGC 3115 becomes increasingly important relative to the spheroid light, reaching its maximum at $R \sim 90''$.
  Beyond $R_{\rm maj} \gtrsim 90''$, the contribution from the disk light starts declining more rapidly than the spheroid light.
  This interpretation is supported by the results of \cite{arnold2011n3115},
  who found that, within $R_{\rm maj} \sim 110''$, the bulge of NGC 3115 is flattened and rotates rapidly ($v/\sigma \gtrsim 1.5$),
  whereas at larger radii the rotation declines dramatically (to $v/\sigma \sim 0.7$), 
  but remains well aligned with the inner regions. 
  From an inspection of the unsharp mask, we identify a faint nuclear edge-on ring ($R_{\rm maj} \sim 15''$), 
  which produces a corresponding peak in the ellipticity profile. 
  %We build our model with a S\'ersic-bulge + exponential disk + Gaussian-ring. 
  We do not observe any nuclear excess of light in the 1D residuals. 
  The addition of a PSF component to the final model does not significantly change the outcome of the fit.

  NGC 3414 is a peculiar lenticular/elliptical galaxy. 
  Different interpretations have been proposed about the morphology of this galaxy.
  \cite{whitmore1990} suggested that NGC 3414 is an spheroidal galaxy 
  with a large-scale edge-on polar ring, rather than a face-on barred lenticular galaxy.
  \cite{laurikainen2010} decomposed NGC 3414 as a barred lenticular galaxy, but 
  they cautioned against the uncertainty of their solution due to the possible misinterpretation of the galaxy morphology.
  The unsharp mask clearly shows that an embedded component does not extend all the way through the 
  center of the galaxy, but instead it is truncated at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 20''$.
  However, an elongated structure in the galaxy center resembles a nuclear edge-on disk ($R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 5''$).
  The velocity map shows rotation within $R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 5''$, no rotation within $5'' \lesssim R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 15''$,
  and counterrotation beyond $R_{\rm maj} \gtrsim 15''$.
  The velocity pattern is consistent with the galaxy being a spheroidal system containing an edge-on polar ring and an edge-on nuclear disk.

  NGC 3998 is a barred lenticular galaxy with a Seyfert AGN and nuclear dust \citep{knapp1996n3998}.
  Despite its large stellar velocity dispersion, this galaxy does not have a partially depleted core. 
  \cite{gutierrez2011} identified a bar at $R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 8''$, a ring between $30'' \lesssim R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 50''$, and  
  an antitruncation in the light profile of the disk at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 122''$.
  \cite{laurikainen2010} found that NGC 3998 features a weak bar at $R_{\rm maj} < 8''$,
  a bright lens at $R_{\rm maj} < 15''$ and a weak bump in the surface brightness profile at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 40''$.
  We see three distinct peaks in the ellipticity profile.
  The first two peaks occur at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 7''$ and $R_{\rm maj} \sim 15''$, and they correspond to a weak bar and to a faint 
  oval component, respectively.
  These components are fit with two Ferrer functions.
  The third peak at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 35''$ coincides with a bump in the surface brightness profile and is produced by a ring.
  The AGN component is modeled with a Gaussian profile.

  NGC 4459 is a lenticular galaxy.
  Its disk profile is reported to have an antitruncation at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 119''$ \citep{gutierrez2011}.
  The ellipticity constantly increases across all the observed radial range ($R_{\rm maj} \lesssim 100''$).
  This is an indication that, going from the galaxy center to the outskirts,
  the disk component becomes increasingly more important over the spheroidal component.
  However, the lack of a plateau in the ellipticity profile at large radii implies that at $R_{\rm maj} \sim 100''$ 
  the contribution from the bulge is still significant compared to that of the disk.
  In fact, the surface brightness profile does not display an exponential decline at large radii.
  We note that the antitruncation reported by \cite{gutierrez2011} could be an artificial feature 
  produced by the transition between the radial range where the disk becomes increasingly more important 
  over the bulge and the truly exponential decline of the disk beyond $R_{\rm maj} \gtrsim 119''$.
  We do not find evidence for any embedded components in our data.

  The isophotal parameters do not show any evidence for embedded components.
  However, fitting NGC 4564 with a S\'ersic + exponential model results in bad residuals.
  In the unsharp mask, one can hardly glimpse an oval structure extending out to $R \lesssim 15''$.
  The addition of a Ferrer function to the model dramatically improves the fit and smoothes the residuals.
  Although the lack of strong evidence for the presence of a (faint) third component, 
  we prefer to model the lens with a Ferrer function 
  because of the notable improvement in the goodness of the global fit.

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  The morphology of this galaxy is quite complex. 
  The bar extends out to $R \lesssim 50''$ and concludes in two evident ansae.
  The large-scale disk features a wide ring that is responsible for the curvature in the light profile observed within 
  $60'' \lesssim R \lesssim 130''$ (see also \citealt{comeron2014}).
  An additional embedded disk-like component ($R \lesssim 15''$) can be recognized in the B4 profile and in the velocity map.
  The bump in the light profile within $60'' \lesssim R \lesssim 70''$ corresponds to the ansae of the bar.
  This data range has therefore been excluded from the fit.
  The large scale bar is fit with a Ferrer function and the inner disk with a S\'ersic profile.

  {\bf NGC 4697 \\}

  NGC 4697 is an elliptical galaxy with an embedded disk \cite{scorzabender1995}.

  %\cite{grahamdriver2007} modeled this galaxy with a S\'ersic-bulge model
  %($n = 4.0$).
  %\cite{sani2011} described it with a S\'ersic-bulge 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 100'.5$, $n = 5.0$). 
  %\cite{vika2012} proposed a single S\'ersic-bulge model 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 39''.1$, $n = 3.8$) 
  %or a S\'ersic-bulge + exponential-disk model 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 10''.0$, $n = 2.9$).
  %\cite{beifiori2012} chose a single S\'ersic-bulge 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 128''.7$, $n = 5.0$).
  %\cite{lasker2014data} decomposed NGC 4697 into a S\'ersic-bulge + exponential-disk + PSF-nucleus + S\'ersic-envelope 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 6''.3$, $n = 2.1$).

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  The velocity map and the unsharp mask of NGC 4697 clearly show 
  the presence of an intermediate-size disk embedded in the main spheroid.
  However, the ellipticity profile presents two peaks. 
  The peak at $R \sim 40''$ corresponds to the embedded disk already mentioned,
  while the peak at $R \sim 10''$ unveils a second inner disk-like component.
  After testing different decomposition models, 
  in which we fit the embedded disks with a set of different functions (exponential, S\'ersic, Ferrer)
  but we always described the main spheroidal component with a S\'ersic profile,
  we noticed that the bulge parameters did not vary significantly among the various decompositions.
  Our preferred model for NGC 4697 consists of a S\'ersic-bulge + 2 S\'ersic-inner disks.

  {\bf NGC 4945 \\}

  TBD!!! \\
  NGC 4945 is an edge-on, dusty spiral galaxy that hosts a Seyfert AGN \citep{lin2011}.

  \cite{kormendy2010} found that the bulge of NGC 4945 is best modeled with a low-$n$ S\'ersic function
  ($n = 1.3$).

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  Given the edge-on inclination of this object, the identification of a possible large-scale bar is complicated.
  The light profile has an obvious bump that could be interpreted in two different ways.
  The bump could be produced by a large-scale bar; 
  in this case, either the disk must have a truncation happening at a radius smaller than the length of the bar,
  or its light profile cannot be exponential (this condition can be caused by the high inclination of the galaxy).
  Alternatively, the bump could be due by the galaxy spiral arms, the disk has an exponential profile with no truncation
  and the galaxy has no bar.
  After checking that both scenarios result in similar best-fit parameters for the bulge, 
  we choose the second and simpler hypothesis.
  We exclude form the fit the data between $R \sim 100''-400''$, where the spiral arm would contribute to the galaxy light,
  and we also exclude the innermost $6''.4$ due to the presence of the AGN.
  Our final model for NGC 4945 consists of a S\'ersic-bulge + exponential-disk.

  NGC 5845 is an elliptical/lenticular galaxy. 

  %\cite{grahamdriver2007} modeled this galaxy with a S\'ersic-bulge 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 4''.1$,$n = 3.2$).
  %\cite{sani2011} fit it with a S\'ersic-bulge 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 3''.7$, $n = 3.0$). 
  %\cite{vika2012} used a S\'ersic-bulge model 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 3''.5$, $n = 2.6$).
  %\cite{beifiori2012} chose a single S\'ersic-bulge 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 4''.1$, $n = 3.5$).
  %\cite{lasker2014data} described this galaxy with a S\'ersic-bulge 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 3''.5$, $n = 2.8$).

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  The small apparent size of NGC 5845 (compared to the PSF FWHM) implies low resolution for the data 
  and complications for the modeling of this galaxy.
  Here, looking at the unsharp mask and the velocity field, we identify 
  a disk component, either large-scale or embedded.
  To rule out one of the two cases, a good test would be to check whether
  the light profile of NGC 5845 presents an exponential decline in its outer part.
  Unfortunately, the IRAC image is not deep enough and beyond $R \gtrsim 23''$ the galaxy light 
  is fainter than $3 RMS_{\rm SKY}$.
  %Since the too small radial range prevents us from disentangling between an embedded and a large-scale disk,
  %we choose the most statistically significant solution (lowest $\chi^2$), 
  %but we caution that the best fit parameters might be biased by a non adequate choice
  %of the model components. 
  %However, our results are in agreement with those from \cite{jia2012}, 
  %who study the structure and kinematics of NGC5845 with HST/WFPC2 data 
  %and previously published spatially resolved kinematics, and unambiguously identify a 
  %large scale disk in both the photometry and the kinematics. \\
  The ellipticity profile has a peak at $R \sim 13''$ and therefore suggests that the disk is indeed embedded.
  However, when fitting NGC 5845 with a S\'ersic + exponential model, 
  the lowest-$\chi^2$ solution does not reproduce an inner disk, but rather a large-scale one.
  This is because the S\'ersic and the exponential function are degenerate in this decomposition, 
  due to the small number of data points sampling the galaxy light profile.

  NGC 5846 is an elliptical galaxy with a partially depleted core ($R_{\rm break} = 1''.2$, \citealt{rusli2013}).
  This galaxy has a LINER nucleus \citep{carrillo1999} and filamentary nuclear dust \citep{tran2001}.

  %\cite{sani2011} modeled this galaxy with a S\'ersic-bulge
  %($R_{\rm e} = 36''.4$, $n = 3.0$). 
  %\cite{vika2012} used a S\'ersic-bulge + mask-core model

  %\cite{rusli2013} fit this galaxy with a core-S\'ersic profile 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 113''.2$, $n = 5.3$). 

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  This galaxy has a strong isophotal twist between its center and $R \sim 70''$, and
  its light profile presents a slight bump at $R \sim 20''$.
  However, the isophotal parameters, the unsharp mask and the velocity map lack of clear evidence for an embedded component.
  We thus model NGC 5846 with a single S\'ersic profile, after masking the innermost $6''.1$.

  %($R_{\rm e} = 26''.6$, $n = 4.2$). 

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  A single S\'ersic function provides a fairly good description of the surface brightness profile of NGC 7052.
  However, the residuals of such fit display a curious behaviour, having a nuclear light excess along the major-axis 
  and a nuclear light deficit along the equivalent-axis. 
  This pattern is still present when the innermost $6''.1$ are excluded and the fit is repeated with a S\'ersic profile.
  The reasons for this are unclear. 
  The best-fit parameters obtained from a single S\'ersic fit, without excluding the innermost data points,
  are not significantly different from those obtained when excluding the core region (see Table \ref{tab:n7052}).
  Given the uncertainty connected to the nuclear region of this galaxy,
  we preferred the model that incorporates the exclusion of the innermost $6''.1$, 
  with the caveat about the ambiguous presence of a partially depleted core.

  %($R_{\rm e} = 100''.1$, $n = 9.3$). 

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  We identified an embedded disk signaled by the peak at $R \sim 10''$ in the ellipticity profile.
  The velocity map of this galaxy confirms the presence of a fast rotating component (Falcon-Barroso private comm.).
  We modeled NGC 7619 with a S\'ersic + inner-exponential model.
  We note that the residuals obtained from our best-fit model do not suggest the presence of a partially depleted core,
  whereas they display a nuclear lack of light when the galaxy is modeled with a single S\'ersic-bulge.

  {\bf NGC 7768 \\}

  NGC 7768 is an elliptical galaxy with a partially depleted core ($R_{\rm break} = 0''.3$, \citealt{rusli2013}).

  %\cite{rusli2013} modeled this galaxy with a core-S\'ersic profile 
  %($R_{\rm e} = 46''.1$, $n = 6.2$). 

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  The image of NGC 7768 is corrupted by a saturated star, which lies close to the galaxy.
  The sky background is not constant across the image.
  To be safe, we fit only the innermost $R \lesssim 30''$, where the contribution from the background is negligible.
  The data within $R < 6''.1$ are excluded from the fit due to the presence of a partially depleted core.
  Our best-fit model consists of a single S\'ersic profile.

  UGC 03789 is a face-on spiral galaxy.

  \emph{1D fit -- }
  This galaxy features a ring ($R \sim 20''$) and a nuclear bar ($R \lesssim 4''$),
  which can be seen in the unsharp mask and produces corresponding peaks in the ellipticity and PA profiles.

\section{1D analytical functions}
\label{sec:app1}
Here we provide the mathematical expressions of the analytical functions used to model 
the observed surface brightness profiles, $\mu(R)$, of galaxies.
The projected galactic radius, $R$,
corresponds to the distance of the isophotes from the galaxy center (along either the major- or equivalent-axis). \\

The \citeauthor{sersic1963} (\citeyear{sersic1963,sersic1968}) model is a three-parameter function of the following form:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rm S\acute{e}rsic}(\mu_{\rm e},R_{\rm e},n;R) = \mu_{\rm e} + \frac{2.5~b_{\rm n}}{\ln(10)} 
\Biggl[\biggl(\frac{R}{R_{\rm e}}\biggr)^{1/n}-1\Biggr] ,
\end{equation}
\citep{caon1993,andredakis1995,grahamdriver2005}
where $\mu_{\rm e}$ is the surface brightness at the effective radius $R_{\rm e}$ that encloses 
half of the total light from the model. 
The S\'ersic index $n$ is the parameter that measures the curvature of the radial light profile,
and $b_{\rm n}$ is a scalar value defined in terms of the S\'ersic index $n$ such that:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(2n) = 2\gamma(2n,b_{\rm n}),
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is the complete gamma function \citep{ciotti1991} 
and $\gamma$ is the incomplete gamma function defined by 
\begin{equation}
\gamma(2n,x) = \int_{0}^{x} {\rm e}^{-t} t^{2n-1} {\rm d}t .
\end{equation} \\

The exponential model is a special case ($n=1$) of the S\'ersic model.
It can therefore be written as a two-parameter function such that:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rm exponential}(\mu_{\rm 0},h;R) = \mu_{\rm 0} + \frac{2.5}{\ln(10)} \biggl(\frac{R}{h} \biggr) ,
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rm 0}$ is the central surface brightness and $h$ is the scale length equal to $R_{\rm e}/1.678$. \\

The Gaussian model is another special case ($n=0.5$) of the S\'ersic model, and thus also a two-parameter function of the following form:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rm Gaussian}(\mu_{\rm 0},FWHM;R) = \mu_{\rm 0} + \frac{2.5}{\ln(10)} 
\biggl[\frac{R^2}{2(FWHM/2.355)^2} \biggr] ,
\label{eq:gauss}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rm 0}$ is the central surface brightness 
and $FWHM$ is the full width at half maximum of the Gaussian profile. \\

The \cite{moffat1969} model is a three-parameter function that can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rm Moffat}(\mu_{\rm 0},\alpha,\beta;R) = \mu_{\rm 0} - 2.5 
\log \Biggl[ 1 + \biggl( \frac{R}{\alpha} \biggr)^2 \Biggr]^{-\beta} ,
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rm 0}$ is the central surface brightness,
$\alpha$ is related to the $FWHM$ through 
\begin{equation}
FWHM = 2\alpha \sqrt{2^{1/\beta}-1} ,
\end{equation}
and $\beta$ regulates the shape of the profile at large radii. \\

The Ferrer model is a four-parameter function defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rm Ferrer}(\mu_{\rm 0},R_{\rm out},\alpha,\beta;R) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    \mu_{\rm 0} - 2.5 \log \Biggl[ 1 - \biggl(\frac{R}{R_{\rm out}} \biggr)^{2-\beta} \Biggr]^{\alpha} 
    & \quad \text{for $R<R_{\rm out}$}\\
    +\infty & \quad \text{for $R\geq R_{\rm out}$}
  \end{array} \right. ,
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rm 0}$ is the central surface brightness,
$\alpha$ controls the sharpness of the truncation,
$\beta$ is related to the central slope,
and $R_{\rm out}$ is the outer radial limit within which the function is defined. \\

The symmetric Gaussian ring is a three-parameter function of the following form:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rm Gaussian}(\mu_{\rm 0},R_{\rm 0},FWHM;R) = \mu_{\rm 0} + \frac{2.5}{\ln(10)} 
\biggl[\frac{(R-R_{\rm 0})^2}{2(FWHM/2.355)^2} \biggr] ,
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rm 0}$ and $FWHM$ have the same meaning as in equation \ref{eq:gauss}, 
and $R_{\rm 0}$ is the radius at which the Gaussian profile is centered. \\
