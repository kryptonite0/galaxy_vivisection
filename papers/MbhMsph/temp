In our first paper, we performed a detailed (i.e.~bulge, disks, bars, spiral arms, rings, halo, nucleus, etc.) 
decomposition of 66 galaxies, with directly measured black hole masses, $M_{ BH}$, 
that had been imaged at $3.6~\mu m$ with \emph{Spitzer}.
Our sample is the largest to date and, for the first time, the decompositions were checked for consistency with the galaxy kinematics. 
We present correlations between $M_{ BH}$ 
and the host spheroid (and galaxy) luminosity, $L_{ sph}$ (and $L_{ gal}$), 
and also stellar mass, $M_{ *,sph}$.
While most previous studies have used galaxy samples that were overwhelmingly dominated by high-mass, early-type galaxies,
our sample includes 17 spiral galaxies, half of which have $M_{ BH} < 10^7~M_\odot$, 
and allows us to better investigate the poorly studied low-mass end of the $M_{ BH} - M_{ *,sph}$ correlation.
The bulges of early-type galaxies follow $M_{ BH} \propto M_{ *,sph}^{1.04 \pm 0.10}$  
and define a tight 
\emph{red sequence} with intrinsic scatter $\epsilon_{(M_{ BH}|M_{ *,sph})} = 0.43 \pm 0.06~dex$ 
and a median $M_{ BH}/M_{ *,sph}$ ratio of $0.68 \pm 0.04\%$, 
i.e.~a $\pm 2\sigma$ range of 0.1--5\%.
At the low-mass end, the bulges of late-type galaxies define a much steeper 
\emph{blue sequence}, 
with $M_{ BH} \propto M_{ *,sph}^{2-3}$ and $M_{ BH}/M_{ *,sph}$ equal to $0.02\%$ at $M_{ BH} \approx 10^6~ M_\odot$, 
indicating that gas-rich processes feed the black hole more efficiently than the host bulge as they coevolve. 
We additionally report that: i) our S\'ersic galaxy sample follows $M_{ BH} \propto M_{ *,sph}^{1.48 \pm 0.20}$, 
a less steep sequence than previously reported; 
ii) bulges with S\'ersic index $n_{ sph}<2$, argued by some to be pseudo-bulges, 
are not offset to lower $M_{ BH}$ from the correlation defined by the current bulge sample with $n_{ sph}>2$; 
and iii) $L_{ sph}$ and $L_{ gal}$ correlate equally well with $M_{ BH}$, in terms of intrinsic scatter, only for early-type galaxies 
-- once reasonable numbers of spiral galaxies are included, the correlation with $L_{ sph}$ is better than that with $L_{ gal}$.
