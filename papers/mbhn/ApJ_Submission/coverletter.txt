Dear Editor,

I am sending you my latest manuscript that I would like you to consider for publication in ApJ. 
This manuscript is meant to be the third paper of the series named "Supermassive black holes and their host spheroids". 
The first and second paper of this series have recently been accepted for publication in ApJ. 
The manuscript I am sending you now presents an analysis of the correlation between black hole mass and host spheroid Sersic index. 

To avoid potential conflicts of interest and biased referees, I politely ask that members of the self-named "Nuker team" (Gultelkin et al. 2009) 
should not be allowed to see this manuscript prior to publication. 
There have been ongoing tensions since Graham et al. (2003) revealed serious flaws with the new Nuker model. 
I would be glad to have my manuscript reviewed by the same referee that assessed Paper I and II of this series, 
since she or he will already be familiar with my research work and should find easy to review this third (short) study. 

Thank you for receiving my manuscript and considering it for review. 
I appreciate your time and look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Giulia Savorgnan
