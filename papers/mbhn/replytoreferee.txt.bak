I thank the referee for a prompt and insightful review that helped improve the quality of the manuscript. 
I have modified the manuscript as suggested by the referee, and highlighted the changes in boldface. 
Below is my response to the referee report. 

Figures 1 and 2 have been modified to show the insets with error bars on the same scale as the main plots. 
I wish to maintain the fancy symbols for continuity with Paper II and because they allow to identify 
the two lenticular galaxies excluded from the linear regression analysis (orange crosses) and
the four galaxies classified as E/S0 or S0/Sp. 
If I was to show only the four-color error bars, these six data points could not be easily located. 
I tried to combine fancy symbols and error bars in a single panel, but the result was a messy and 
too "crowded" plot. 
Hopefully a two-panel figure - with separate symbols and error bars - is a good compromise. 

The linear regression for the "all" sample is now shown with a black dotted line in both Figures 1 and 2. 
Indeed, the Figures are now more informative. 
Looking at the bottom panel of Figure 1, one can notice that the blue and orange error bars 
span basically the same range in spheroid magnitude and Sersic index, but they are offset from each other. 
In effect, the L-n linear regression for all galaxies seems to almost exactly define a separation line 
in between lenticular and spiral galaxies. 
Going beyond a "by eye" assessment, the linear regression analysis, which takes into account the error bars, 
confirms that the slopes of the correlations for early- and late-type galaxies are not consistent with each other
within their 1 sigma uncertainties. 
This is already a quantitative indication that early- and late-type galaxies define two separate L-n sequences, 
which justifies the use of a 4-parameter model, rather than a 2-parameter one, to describe the L-n diagram. 
I've also explored an independent method, drawn from Information Theory, to measure the relative quality of 
a 2-parameter and a 4-parameter model for the given L-n dataset. 
The Akaike Information Criterion rewards the goodness of a fit and penalizes the number of parameter used 
in the model, therefore it provides a means for model selection. 
The Akaike Information Criterion test confirms that a 4-parameter model is preferred over a 2-parameter model 
to describe the L-n diagram, whereas a 2-parameter model is preferred over a 4-parameter model to describe 
the Mbh-n dataset. 
Details about the Akaike Information Criterion are given in the manuscript (Section 3.1). 

Indeed, I agree with the referee's concern about the uncertain and sometimes misleading definition of "bulge" 
adopted in the literature, which led us to prefer the use of a more general term such as "spheroid" as opposed 
to disk, although we recognize that "spheroid" might not be fully appropriate to describe disk-like pseudobulges. 
In Papers I, II and III, as long as in Savorgnan & Graham (2016, MNRAS, 457, 320), we adopted and tried to be 
consistent with a point of view similar to that of the ATLAS3D team: local galaxies display a continuous distribution 
of spheroid-to-total flux ratios (e.g. Figure 2 of Cappellari et al. 2011), going from disk-less, "pure" 
elliptical galaxies (slow rotators) to disk-dominated lenticular and spiral galaxies (fast rotators). 
In Paper I, we consistently modelled each galaxy's spheroid with a Sersic profile. Our identification of the spheroidal 
component can probably be classified as a "photometric" identification: we associated the spheroid with the central 
excess of light after the subtraction of disks, bars, nuclei, rings and disk-like comp0nents (possibly pseudobulges?).
